## !!!IMPORTANT

- We are using OpenAI api key and since the repository is public, openAI might disable the API key which will result in the chatbot not working
- To fix, this you can use your own open AI key by going on the website and use it.
- To do so, go on src/chat-api/index.ts, section apiKey field.
